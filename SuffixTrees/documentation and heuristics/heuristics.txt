Scoring Criteria

1. Ratio of length of tale/ no. of times needed words appear (the lower this value the better)
2. Number of words in the query that were there in the tale
3. Whether the sequence of the words appearing in the tale was same as the query string 

Each of these criteria has 30 points
Initially, each story is given a max possible score of 100 points.

Criteria 1:
1. If none of the words in the query string occur in the tale, 30 points are subtracted from the total
2. If this score is above 200, this means some words matched but very few times or the string is too long. So 20 points are subtracted
3. If this score is between 100 and 200, some words match, and the string is moderately long, so 10 points are subtracted
4. Else it is a good string and nothing is subtracted.

Criteria 2:
1. If all the words in the query string are not present in the tale, we subtract 30 points.

Criteria 3:
1. If the words did not appear in the tale in the same order that they appeared in the query string, 30 points were subtracted (if sorted = 0)

Ranking:
1. Based on the score, the rank is given using [11 - (Score/10)]
2. Documents with thw same score will have the same rank. 
3. Since the ranks are not relative to eachother, the ranks may not be sequential.
