The code for building the suffix tree is loosely based on Ukkonen's algorithm 
which I read up about on geeksforgeeks, but the method of implementation
is very different from the one done there.

The code and input along with how to run it is in the "code and input" folder.

The documentation indicating complexity and the heuristics used for the 
3rd part are in the folder "documentation and heuristics".

The test cases given along with the outputs for each case are in folder 
"test cases and inputs".
